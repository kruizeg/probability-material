\begin{exercise} BH.10.3
This is just a funny exercise, but I wonder whether it has a practical value.
\begin{hint}
First check the assumption that $Y\neq a X$, for some $a>0$; why is it there?
Then, take a suitable $g$ in Jensen's inequality.
Bigger hint: $g(x)=1/x$.

In the solution guide, the authors do not explain the $>$, while in Jensen's inequality there is a $\leq$. To see why the $>$ is allowed here, rethink the assumption in the exercise, and reread Theorem 10.1.5.

Finally, at what $p$ is $p(1-p)$ maximal?
\end{hint}
