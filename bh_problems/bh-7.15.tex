\begin{exercise}BH.7.15
\begin{hint}
Make a drawing.
\end{hint}
\begin{solution}
Use the hint, that is, really make the drawing of the rectangle mentioned in the exercise. (If you refuse to to this, then nothing can  help you to understand the rest of the answer.) Then, in the drawing, note that $F(x,y)$ is the area of an (infinite) square lying  south west of the point $(x,y)$. Add and subtract such (infinite) squares until the square $[a_1,a_2] \times [b_{1},b_2]$ is covered exactly once. Realize that in the process, the square $(-\infty, a_1] \times (-\infty, b_1]$ is subtracted twice.
